A Game Against Nature is an epsilon-player game, in which a single rational self-interested player must choose a strategy, and the outcome and the player’s payoff depends on both his chosen strategy and the “choice” made by a totally disinterested nature. Nature's practical role is to act as a random number generator.

Implemented criteria:
* Wald
* Savage
* Hurwicz
* Hodges–Lehmann
* Laplace
* Maximum Expected Payoff
* Minimum Expected Regret
* etc

Don't forget your Last Will and Testament, hopeful winner!
