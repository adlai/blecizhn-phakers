A Game Against Nature is an epsilon-player game, in which a single rational self-interested player must choose a strategy, and the outcome and the player’s payoff depends on both his chosen strategy and the “choice” made by a totally disinterested nature. Nature's practical role is to act as a random number generator.

Implemented criteria:
* Wald criterion
* Savage criterion
* Hurwicz criterion
* Hodges–Lehmann criterion
* Laplace criterion
* Maximum Expected Payoff criterion
* Minimum Expected Regret criterion
* and more
